    <h2>A Short Biography</h2>
    
    <div id = "d1"><p>
        I may not have been around the world, but ive certainly been around the block.
        ive worked in the hospitality industry for the last 10 years.
        I also work for a design firm and helped produce million dollar
        weddings and parties.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    
    <div id = "d2"><p>
        After completing high school in Indianapolis, I attended Holy Cross
        College in South Bend, IN. The easiest way to help people remember Holy Cross
        is to remind them that it is the school Rudy attended in the movie "Rudy" before
        he was accepted into Notre Dame. After completing my Associates degree there
        I moved to Louisville, KY where I recieved an associates degree in Culinary arts
        and a Bachelors Degree in Hospitality Management.

    <h4> Work and Travels</h4>
    
    <div id = "d3"><p>
        I came back to Indianapolis after I finished all my schooling and
        started work at my Dad's law firm; it was work unrelated to my degrees
        but he needed help running his private firm and I was happy to lend a hand
        doing all the small and menial things while he focused on more important and complex
        problems. When he could get along without me, I moved to Colorado to work
        in my field. I cooked at a couple restaurants in Aspen and Snowmass. I also worked
        for a wedding and event planner in Aspen; we did some amazing thing there, things
        that I will always be proud of.I loved living in the Colorado Rockies, but being
        that far from my family in Indianapolis was difficult. Eventually I decided to move back.
        Now i'm starting a new chapter in my life at Kenzie Acadamey.
